# Real-Time-Example-AddressBook-Project
ADDRESS-BOOK
An address book project in C is a simple application designed to store and manage contact information, such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of its key components:
Data Structure: Typically, a struct is used to define the contact information. This may include fields like name, phone number, and email.
CRUD Operations:
Create: Add new contacts.
Read: Display existing contacts.
Edit:Modify existing contact information.
Delete:Remove contacts.
Storage:Contacts can be stored in memory (using arrays or linked lists) or in files for persistent storage.
User Interface: The program often includes a simple text-based menu for user interaction, allowing users to select options for different operations.
Error Handling: Basic error handling ensures that the program behaves correctly, such as checking for duplicate entries or invalid input.
This project serves as a great exercise in data handling, file I/O, and basic C programming concepts
